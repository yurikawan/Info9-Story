\section{It is doomed to be an unpeaceful night. Near the cove, a factious fight is in progress. Beleaguered by hoods, a middle-aged man with only one strange red eye runs away. The man turns into a narrow street, followed by FBI unexpectedly. Blood is dripping, but he keeps sprinting. A devious store stands at the end of the shabby street.  Following the man, the FBI go into the store. The man stops in front of the counter. He bents down on the floor, and crawls three times in a counterclockwise direction. Suddenly, a secret door gradually appears on the wall. A crazy sculpture exhibition is holding behind the door. Sculptures are assembled arbitrarily. Although they range in size, they are all concrete block sculptures. The man walks through the crows without accosting anyone. He keeps walking until he reaches this special sculpture in the right corner of the room. It is an incredibly lifelike carving of a young girl's head, but some bizarre red spots destroy the whole beauty of her alluring face. The sculpture is putted inside a dark red, enormous spoon. Staring at the carving, he soliloquizes. "Why she looks like her? " His voice is shivering.} 
\section{The dim lights keep flickering. A garrulous mercenary can't bear them and bursts into expletives:"What the hell is going on! I can't stand the damn lights anymore!"}
\section{"tluck..tlock...tluck..tlock" the sculpture of the young girl is dripping blood, drop by drop. No one noticed. The girl raises sides of her lip. Her smile is sweet and innocent in a bizarre way. } 
\section{The man keeps staring at the sculpture for a moment. Then, he picks out a small doll from the left pocket of his wind coat. He puts it besides the statue, bends down his body, and kisses the carving. As soon as his lip touches the forehead of the sculpture, the light goes out. Everyone is in complete quiet darkness. Someone is singing blithely…}

\section{In a scenic town, lived a happy family. There are five people in the family, father, mother, little brother and a little girl. Father is a debonair man; the mother is an affable woman. What felicity this family has. From one day, for an unknown reason, father's one eye becomes red whenever the night comes and he never gets older since then. 
\section{The birds are singing; the flowers are blooming; the sun is shining. What a beautiful day. Today, the father goes out of the town on a fourteen-day-business-trip. Days pass. Nothing strange happen until the thirteen day's midnight. It is a peaceful night. Suddenly, a scream breaks the peace of night. The brother and the little girl are sleeping under the bed. The little girl awakes. She can't see anything except a red eye and the cold light of the blade. It stares maliciously at the bed.  Blood is splashing; blood is pouring … }

 \section{Waking up, the little girl finds his father back home with an alluring woman and a small boy who is always holding a cute doll in his hands. Surprisedly, the room is clean and tidy, just like it used to be. Blood has disappeared with the mother. No one knows where they go. Something strange happens. Whenever the little girl asks others about her mother, everyone claims that she has already disappeared for years. Everything is normal again, except there are six people in the family now. }

\section{The litter girl has heard some story about witches magic when she was very young. When she was around 3-4 years old, her mother often told her some scary story about witches living in the countryside, who fed on other family's felicity to maintain their eternal beauty. Once a family is chosen by the witch, no one in the family would be able to survive. This alluring woman standing in front of the little girl reminds her of the witch described by her mother: shiny blue eyes, fire-like red hair, with a sense of wickedness permeating around her beauty.}

\section{"The only way to save the family is to make everyone in the family realize that a vicious creature has invaded the family." her mother once told her :" which is only possible when the witch reveal her real look -- they all evolve from fox." "But how could they reveal their original look?" the little girl curiously asked her mother. "By digging out their eyes. Remember, their eyes will turn red at night -- that's part of the reason they pretend that they sleep early at night to avoid being found out. By replacing your eyes with their eyes, they will reveal their real look." Her mother answered her. "But that's still not the end of the story..." Her mother stared at her daughter and whispered...It's only 8 o' clock after the mother finishes the story, but she goes to bed early as usual.}

\section{The girl believed her mother told her this story with a purpose. Somehow her mother could predict the tragedy that would befall on the family, and warned her ahead. "Maybe Mama hope by the time when this catastrophe come I would be able to save the family..." the little girl murmured. But what confused her is:"Why Mama could know ahead that she won't be able to be with me when the witch hit our home? Where is she right now?"}

\section{"No matter what, I will dig our her eyes and kill her -- the wicked witch who want to destroy my family!" The girl said with resentment, fire flaming in her eyes.}

\section{It's doomed to be unpeaceful night. The clock keep ticking, the water keep dripping. The little brother keep crying. The moon keep hiding behind the cloud. The world smells of blood and sadness. A raspy scream comes out of the house hiding in the shade. The litter girl stared at the women's hollow eyes, the two eyeballs rolling on the floor. The alluring woman stared to transform. In the chaos of transformation, the girl had the illusion, at one moment, that she saw her mother. But the shadow of her mother quickly disappears. The beautiful woman turns into a white fox. The father was horrified by the scene and faints, leaving the little girl alone watching the process of the white fox become transparent and then disappear.}

\section{The little girl picks up the knife and eyeballs on the floor, murmuring to herself:"For the family, for papa, for mama, for..." She pierced the knife into her eye. The world suddenly turned red. In the chaotic redness, she saw her mother again, who is holding the red eyeball and looking at her with extreme sadness. The girl faints, when she woke up, she finds herself inside a room filled with scupltures.}

\section{"Welcome! Wizard 10023!" She heard a voice bumping in the room. She follows the direction of the voice, and finds out a mirrow. She stared at the mirror, and see a white fox.}

\section{The girl suddenly realizes everything. But she gets no choice. Neither does her mother.}
