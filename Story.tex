\section{It is doomed to be an unpeaceful night. Near the cove, a factious fight is in progress. Beleaguered by hoods, a middle-aged man with only one strange red eye runs away. The man turns into a narrow street, followed by FBI unexpectedly. Blood is dripping, but he keeps sprinting. A devious store stands at the end of the shabby street.  Following the man, the FBI go into the store. The man stops in front of the counter. He bents down on the floor, and crawls three times in a counterclockwise direction. Suddenly, a secret door gradually appears on the wall. A crazy sculpture exhibition is holding behind the door. Sculptures are assembled arbitrarily. Although they range in size, they are all concrete block sculptures. The man walks through the crows without accosting anyone. He keeps walking until he reaches this special sculpture in the right corner of the room. It is an incredibly lifelike carving of a young girl's head, but some bizarre red spots destroy the whole beauty of her alluring face. The sculpture is putted inside a dark red, enormous spoon. Staring at the carving, he soliloquizes. "Why she looks like her? " His voice is shivering.} 
\section{The dim lights keep flickering. A garrulous mercenary can't bear them and bursts into expletives:"What the hell is going on! I can't stand the damn lights anymore!"}
\section{"tluck..tlock...tluck..tlock" the sculpture of the young girl is dripping blood, drop by drop. No one noticed. The girl raises sides of her lip. Her smile is sweet and innocent in a bizarre way. } 
\section{The man keeps staring at the sculpture for a moment. Then, he picks out a small doll from the left pocket of his wind coat. He puts it besides the statue, bends down his body, and kisses the carving. As soon as his lip touches the forehead of the sculpture, the light goes out. Everyone is in complete quiet darkness. Someone is singing blithely…}
