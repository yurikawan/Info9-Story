\section{"For thousands of years, I have stayed inside secretly, watching different periods of people, coming by and walking away. I am always waiting for you to come. Nobody has ever known and seen me until now."}

\section{Moon is drowsily shining in the sky. It is doomed to be an unpeaceful night. Near the cove, a factious fight is in progress. Beleaguered by hoods, a middle-aged man with only one strange red eye runs away. The man turns into a narrow street, followed by FBI unexpectedly. Blood is dripping, but he keeps sprinting. A devious store stands at the end of the shabby street.  Following the man, the FBI go into the store. The man stops in front of the counter. He bents down on the floor, and crawls three times in a counterclockwise direction. Suddenly, a secret door gradually appears on the wall. A crazy sculpture exhibition is holding behind the door. Sculptures are assembled arbitrarily. Although they range in size, they are all concrete block sculptures. }
